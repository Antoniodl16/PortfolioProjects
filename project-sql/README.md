# Customer Behavior Analysis using SQL

## Overview

This project focuses on performing customer behavior analysis using SQL. The objective is to gain insights into various aspects of a movie rental business, including inventory, staff, and customer behavior, in order to identify trends and patterns.

## Dataset

The dataset includes 16 related tables, providing comprehensive information about:
- **Customers**: Name, Address, etc.
- **Business operations**: Staff, Rentals, etc.
- **Inventory**: Films, Categories, etc.

## Queries

The project utilizes SQL queries to extract meaningful insights from the dataset. Some of the key SQL techniques and queries employed include:

- **Aggregate Functions**: `MIN`, `MAX`, `AVG`, `COUNT`, `SUM` to summarize data and calculate metrics.
- **Joins**: Specifically `LEFT JOIN` to combine tables and retrieve relevant information across related datasets.
- **CASE Statements**: Used for conditional logic to categorize data based on specific criteria.
